      introText: "When earning your CPR certification - especially if it is a requirement of your employment or profession - you want to make sure you're getting the highest quality and most up-to-date CPR training.",
      question1: "The training requirements in my state indicate that the CPR and First Aid training must equivalent to the American Heart Association. Does this training meet the requirement?",
      answer1: "Yes! CarePoint Institute (CPI) meets the standards of the American Heart Association and also includes specialized content for those supporting people with Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities, Physical Disabilities and Aging Adults.",
      question2: "How Are CPR Guidelines Created?",
      answer2: "The guidelines for CPR as a life-saving technique are developed through a process of looking at scientific studies that evaluate the likelihood of survival depending on which CPR methods are used. These studies are shared and deliberated at an international conference called International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), which meets every 5 years. The United States liaison of ILCOR is the American Heart Association (AHA). After ILCOR meetings, the AHA publishes updated guidelines on how to best perform CPR, based on what ILCOR decides.",
      question3: "Who Uses ILCOR and AHA Guidelines to Teach CPR?",
      answer3: "Using ILCOR guidelines, communicated by the AHA, training companies are able to form their own systems and curricula for teaching. Among these training companies are the two largest – The American Heart Association and the American Red Cross – as well as several private companies including CarePoint Institute (CPI). All these organizations develop their programs using the same ILCOR CPR guidelines as the framework of their own training process; however, they may teach them in different ways, at different price points, and using different modalities that students can choose from to find the best match that suits their schedules and needs. CPR training companies create curriculum based on the recommendations published by the AHA per ILCOR's deliberations on CPR research. The AHA is not involved in the curriculum-building process outside of their organization and therefore cannot approve other CPR training companies' programs. Choosing CarePoint Insitute (CPI) CPR courses means that you have a training program that follows the guidelines that ILCOR creates and AHA publishes. Through student feedback and professional experience, CarePoint Institute (CPI) has also exceeded the AHA's recommendations when building our curriculum.",
      question4: "Where Can I Learn the Best CPR Skills?",
      answer4: "At CarePoint Institute (CPI), we follow the latest CPR guidelines, but we also add recommendations, tips, and real-world skills from active EMTs and other medical professionals. Students often find that our courses are more up-to-date and more robust than other CPR courses out there, especially given that ILCOR guidelines can take several years to evolve.",
      question5: "Does this accreditation cover Adult, Child, and Infant CPR and AED and First Aid?",
      answer5: "Yes! CarePoint Institute (CPI) meets the requirement for most Medicaid programs that require basic CPR and First Aid.",
      question6: "What is CarePoint Institute's Educational Process?",
      answer6: "CarePoint Institute (CPI) CPR courses strictly adhere to ILCOR and the American Heart Association CPR and ECC/ILCOR guidelines for emergency cardiac care. Our education process is based on best practices, testing, and improving over time to maximize learning and efficiency.",
      question7: "Does this accreditation offer an online only option for certification?",
      answer7: "No, we do not. The skills demonstration must be completed in person with a certified instructor.",
      question8: "How does the Skills Demonstration/Evaluation Work?",
      answer8Part1: "Students are provided with a student manual and support materials. If students have questions, they are able to re-watch videos, use our chat or phone support to get answers from our highly educated staff and instructors.",
      answer8Part2: "Students are also engaged throughout the training with shorter video segments and section pre-test questions that ensures comprehension of the material.",
      answer8Part3: "Upon completion of the training, students take the multiple choice test, which they must pass with an 80% or better.",
      answer8Part4: "The test is remedial, meaning that students are given a helpful explanation when they answer a question incorrectly. In addition, the questions on the final test are randomly chosen from a group of relevant questions developed by our education team, so no test is completely the same. They are also adaptive to each student and identify the areas where a student struggled the most.",
      answer8Part5: "At the end of the test – regardless of pass or fail – students are able to re-watch the videos related to the questions they answered incorrectly. When the student passes the written test, they are able to print out verification.",
      answer8Part6: "Next, the student will meet with a certified skill-evaluator/instructor to perform the hands-on practice. Upon successful completion, the student is awarded a certification card.",
